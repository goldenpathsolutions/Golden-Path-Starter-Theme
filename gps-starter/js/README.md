# main.js
The **main.js** file is where all the JS is minified and concatenated.  

### Do not edit this file, or your changes may be overwritten the next time `gulp` is run

# src/js

The source JS files that are concatenated into main.js are found in src/js.

In order to add js files to be packaged, you need to edit gulpfile.js.

# theme.js

The theme.js file is where the base theme functions live that are provided as part of the starter theme.

# custom.js

### This is where you should add your JS for your project, and during maintenance.

# Other Files

Feel free to add other JS libraries in this directory if you like.  If you run `gulp`, all the js in this directory will be uglified, minified, and contactenated into the main.js file, and enqueued.
